# Ultrasonics

#Forked from the "Ultrasonic" James Burton Repository
In this repository, I'll be trying to adapt this experimental way of tracking indoor objects to virtual reality.
This will be more of a learning project rather than an actual implementation as I'm not that experimented with writing arduino code or making SteamVR drivers.
